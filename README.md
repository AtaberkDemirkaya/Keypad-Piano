# Keypad-Piano
This is my final project for my microcontrollers class. I created a piano with the ATMega328PB Microcontroller, a keypad and a buzzer.
So basically, in the code we select 8 buttons for us to provide different frequency sounds from the buzzer, operating as a musical instrument and in our case as a piano.
Since the keypad and the buzzer were provided within the class for the presentation, I am unable to show to the final form of the project. However with some images, I will try to replicate it.
